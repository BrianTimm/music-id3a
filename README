***music-id3a(linux) README!*** (for Version 1.01)
BEFORE running music-id3a for the first time:
1. Make sure you have id3v2 installed.
2. Make sure that musdir (at top of music-id3a file) contains the full path to your Music directory
3. Make sure that your Music directory contains a folder named "unsorted" (without quotes)
4. Make sure that logdir (at top of music-id3a file) contains the full path to your desired log directory

what music-id3a does:
1. music-id3a will take all files out of their folders within unsorted(up to 2 folders deep).
2. Then all id3 tags will be checked, if a song is missing artist, album, or title tag information it will be placed in a tags-needed folder (there will also be a record of it in the log file.
3. If a song is missing a genre tag it will be logged
4. any file with an extension that isn't mp3 will be placed in a folder named with it's extension (i.e. ogg) so that you can easily convert them later.
5. songs will be placed in the collection folder and will be put into this folder structure:
    musdir/collection/artist/album/track#-title.mp3
if track# is missing from the id3 tag the file will be just title.mp3
6. (optional) down towards the bottom of music-id3a there's a line you can uncomment to have music-id3a clean up the unsorted folder after all the files have been sorted.

planned features for 1.10:
- use of a config file for easier configuration
- some terminal output to keep the user updated on what the script is doing
- ability to configure which tags are critical

planne features for some future version(probably 2.0):
- automated conversion of common filetypes
- automated install (with an install-script)
